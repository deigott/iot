## Technologies and Tools

Let's take a moment to explore the essential technologies and tools integral to this project:

- **K3s:** A lightweight Kubernetes distribution designed for easy deployment and management.
- **K3d:** A tool for running K3s clusters inside Docker containers.
- **Vagrant:** An open-source tool for managing virtual machine environments.
- **Docker:** A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
- **Argo CD:** A GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.
- **GitHub:** A web-based platform for version control and collaboration using Git.
- **Gitlab:** A web-based DevOps platform that provides source code management (SCM), continuous integration, and more.
- **kubectl:** The command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.
- **Linux:** The operating system used for setting up the virtual machines and running various components.

Now that we have a basic understanding of the tools and technologies, let's delve into the project details.
